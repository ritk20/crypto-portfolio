# Crypto Portfolio

This is a personal project aimed at improving my knowledge of blockchain technology, made using React.JS and ethers.JS. I am a relatively new developer, so any suggestions are welcomed.

## Key Features

1. Connect your wallets
2. Add your favourite tokens to your WatchList
3. Transfer Tokens Seamlessly across wallets
4. Check Allowance for Smart Contracts
5. Check Historical Data for individual tokens

## How to use?

- Download/Clone the project <br> `git clone`
- Navigate to project directory <br> `cd crypto-portfolio`
- Install dependencies <br> `npm install`
- Start development build <br> `npm start`
- Open on localhost

_I will deploy it on server as soon as basic features are added_

## Testing

- Tested token transfer on SepoliaEth (testing not done on MainNet)
- Cross-tested Allowance Checker with revoke.cash and Etherscan.io
- Used INFURA for allowance checker
- Used CoinGeckoAPI for historical data (data limited to past 1 year only)
